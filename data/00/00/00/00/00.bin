  |   The WRC championship is the most challenging motor racing             |
  |   competition in the world.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With the new dynamic weather system, climatic conditions have         |
  |   true-to-life effects: rain and snowfall is now an important game      |
  |   feature as variable traction, different set-ups for each stage,       |
  |   tyre choice and shrewd use of the weather forecasting team all need   |
  |   to be considered.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The single-player Career mode has been rebuilt from the ground up:    |
  |   calendar management, R&D to improve performance, staff recruitment    |
  |   and management (mechanics, engineers, medical and weather teams,      |
  |   finance manager, etc.).                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For multiplayer, weekly challenges and WRC eSports return, but the    |
  |   challenge and competition is now even stiffer.                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With 50 teams, 14 rallies and over 100 special stages in the 2019     |
  |   season, WRC 8 has the deepest content ever included in an off-road    |
  |   racing game.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |
  |   * Two cars that left their mark on an era in a booster pack. The      |
  |   Lancia 037 was a legendary Group B car in the 1980s. It was the       |
  |   last rear-wheel drive to win the World Rally Championship. With a     |
  |   4-cylinder 205hp engine, it offers a unique driving experience and    |
  |   is difficult to tame. As for the Porsche 911 GT3 RS RGT, it is a      |
  |   monster of power and technology. Thanks to its flat-six 500hp         |
  |   engine and unmistakable sound, there are no other cars quite like     |
  |   it.                                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Alpine A110 (1973)                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The Alpine A110 is none other than the first car to win the World   |
  |   Rally Championship in the modern era. Many top drivers were           |
  |   successful in the 1970s at the wheel of this Berlinette. Agile and    |
  |   responsive, the Alpine A110 has incredible traction and is            |
  |   particularly adept at negotiating bends.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Ford Escort MkII 1800 (1979)                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Ford is still active in the WRC as an official manufacturer, but    |
  |   it had already made history with its Ford Escort RS1800. Sporting a   |
  |   270hp Cosworth engine, it helped the Detroit manufacturer win its     |
  |   first manufacturers title in 1979. Two years later, Ari Vatanen won   |
  |   the drivers championship with the Escort RS1800.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Lancia Delta HF Integrale Evoluzione (1992)                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The Lancia Delta is the ultimate rally car! With 11 manufacturers   |
  |   titles and 4 drivers titles between 1974 and 1992, no other car has   |
  |   surpassed it in the history of the WRC. It has even won 46 of the     |
  |   65 rallies it has taken part in. With its ultra-high performance,     |
  |   it remains a challenging car to control.                              |
  |                                                                         |
